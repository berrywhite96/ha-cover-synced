# Cover syned

Cover Time Based Component for your [Home-Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io) based on [davidramosweb's Cover Time Based Component](https://github.com/davidramosweb/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-time-based) and [nagyrobi's Cover RF Time based](https://github.com/nagyrobi/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-rf-time-based/),
modified to sync state of cover with the state of switches or existing cover.

### Usage

### Example configuration.yaml entry

```yaml
cover:
    - platform: cover_synced
      devices:
          my_room_cover_time_based:
              name: My Room Cover
              travelling_time_up: 36
              travelling_time_down: 34
              cover_entity_id: cover.watch_entity # either use close_switch_entity_id and open_switch_entity_id or cover_entity_id
              close_switch_entity_id: switch.rf_myroom_cover_down # either use close_switch_entity_id and open_switch_entity_id or cover_entity_id
              open_switch_entity_id: switch.rf_myroom_cover_up # either use close_switch_entity_id and open_switch_entity_id or cover_entity_id
              send_stop_at_ends: False #optional
              aliases: #optional
                  - my_room_cover_time_based
```

All mandatory settings self-explanatory.
Optional settings:

-   `send_stop_at_ends` defaults to `False`. If set to `True`, the Stop script will be run after the cover reaches to 0 or 100 (closes or opens completely). This is for people who use interlocked relays in the scripts to drive the covers, which need to be released when the covers reach the end positions.
-   `aliases`: to override the entity name generated by Home Assistant internally from the (friendly) name.
